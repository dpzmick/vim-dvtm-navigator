vim-dvtm-navigator
==================
If you are a tmux user, vim-tmux-navigator is a great thing to have.

If you are a dvtm user, vim-dvtm-navigator is hopefully a great thing to have.

At the moment, this only works with my (fork)[1] of dvtm, which only works on OS X
(probably, I might forget to update this README though).
